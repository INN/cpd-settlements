Her children also worked with her as community activists to support the rights of criminal suspects and defendants in police custody. In May 2004, Molina was at home visiting with Guzman, her son\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, when officers raided her apartment in the 3500 block of North Halsted Street. Molina and her son, Michael Ortiz, were arrested after officers falsely claimed to find illegal drugs in their possession. Ortiz was also accused of holding plastic explosives, which were in fact compounds used for drywall installation. All of the charges against Ortiz were later dropped after the officers admitted they recovered no illegal substances or other contraband. After the raid, Guzman was instructed to leave and not bother to look for her purse, which contained nearly $400 in cash; she had another $2,000 locked for safekeeping in Molina\u2019s apartment. Later, when Guzman returned, the money from her purse was gone, as was the $2,000, which she had saved over time to rent a new apartment. Molina, who suffered from various medical conditions, was handcuffed to her wheelchair and taken to the 19th District station, where she was booked and taken into custody. Her daughter, April Ortiz, arrived that evening and asked if she could deliver medication for Molina\u2019s health ailments, which included a thyroid condition, asthma and diabetes. Despite her insistence, April Ortiz\u2019s request was denied. Some hours later, Molina\u2019s attorney went to visit her in the lockup. Seeing that she was unwell, he advised that Molina be taken to the hospital. No officers complied with this request for medical attention, and eight hours later, Molina died in her cell. Officers prolonged Michael Ortiz's detention, causing him to miss his mother\u2019s funeral.","magistrate_judge":"","community_area":"Lake View","latitude":41.9463113,"address":"3526 N.

Officer Johnson intervened, determined that Eilman posed a threat to other passengers, and ordered her out of the airport. Eilman contacted her parents in California, who arranged for her to take a different flight the following afternoon. On the day of the flight, Eilman was involved in another verbally aggressive incident, this time with a blind man\u2019s caretaker. Officer Johnson intervened again and had Eilman escorted out of the airport to the CTA station. After another aggressive, verbal disturbance at the CTA station, officers arrested Eilman. They took her to the 8th District station, where she continued to act erratically and demonstrate abnormal behavior. A few hours after her arrest, Officer Delia contacted Eilman\u2019s parents, who explained their daughter\u2019s condition. Officer Delia said Chicago police officers would attempt to help Eilman in her return to California. However, instead of coordinating a return trip or transferring her to a mental health facility, the officers took Eilman, without her possessions, to the 2nd District station. Her family did not receive details about when the officers might release Eilman from custody. Although her behavior demonstrated a need for medical care, the officers kept Eilman in custody for 28 hours. While still experiencing a psychiatric episode, Eilman was released without her luggage in an unfamiliar, high-crime area at 6:30 p.m. near the Robert Taylor Homes. She was abducted, restrained and sexually assaulted in a project building two blocks from where the officers released her, and thrown from a 7th floor window to the ground below . She survived, but suffered severe brain damages, and is impaired for life.","magistrate_judge":"Valdez","community_area":"Garfield Ridge","latitude":41.78657380000001,"address":"5700 S.

On numerous occasions Rubio used ethnic and racial slurs on the plaintiffs, who are all Arab-American, and generally terrorized them to try to get them to move out of their home. To this end, Rubio filed a false report accusing Morad Elusta of assaulting him. Officers Josephs and McCann, fully aware that Rubio's report was false, arrested Morad Elusta at his home. Once in handcuffs, they put Elusta into their squad car, drove it to an alley and parked. The officers then punched, kicked and slammed their squad car's doors on Elusta while yelling ethnic and racial slurs at him. Elusta was injured to a point where he was incapable of exiting the squad car at the police station and was taken by ambulance to a hospital. The assault charges were later dismissed. Almost a year later, Elusta filed a civil rights lawsuit against the two officers. Rubio threatened Elusta to drop his complaint or his house would be raided by police. Rubio and Officers Josephs and McCann then caused a search warrant to be issued for the plaintiffs' home. Right before the search, Elusta was stopped on the sidewalk near his home by Officer Cunningham and thrown to the ground and handcuffed. Officers broke down the plaintiff's front gate and front door. Once inside officers yelled racial slurs while pointing guns at the plaintiffs' heads. Officers ransacked the home, destroying property and stealing money and jewelry. At some point Rubio entered the home while the plaintiffs were being held by police for several hours. No charges were filed against the plaintiffs and officers did not leave a receipt for the money or items they removed from the home.","magistrate_judge":"Cox","community_area":"Ashburn","latitude":41.748182,"address":"7939 S.

When he couldn't comply with their demands, officers drove him to the home he shared with Johnson and Santiago on North Francisco Avenue. When officers arrived Santiago asked to see a warrant or paperwork before she let them into the home. Officers told her if she refused to let them in she had something to hide, so Santiago allowed them to enter. Officers searched the entire home, and found nothing illegal. Once they were done, Padilla asked if he could be let go. The officers ignored him and instead took him to the apartment of his mother, Socorro Padilla. Officers told Socorro Padilla they were trying to help her son with a probation violation in order to get into her home.

Cooper, a 32-year-old decorated police officer, was present in the residence with his two minor sons, his wife and his mother, when officers forcibly entered the home looking for the two cocaine dealers. Assuming the home was being burglarized, Cooper drew his gun. In response, the officers also drew their guns. Cooper presented the officers with his badge and deed to the building, which he had owned for the past four years. Upon realizing that the warrant had the wrong home and that Cooper was a police officer, the officers, including Officer Dailey, decided to execute the search anyway. For 75 minutes, the officers forced the family to stay in one area of the home while the officers and two dogs searched all floors, including an unfinished basement. The officers left after finding no drugs or anyone living in the basement. The officers made reports stating that the Coopers had informed them that one of the cocaine dealers had previously lived in that residence. As a result of this, Cooper lost the trust of his coworkers in the department and has been harassed and intimidated on multiple occasions by off-duty officers waiting in front on his house.","magistrate_judge":"Rowland","community_area":"Austin","latitude":41.899071,"address":"1015 N.

After Obrycka refused to continue serving Officer Abbate, he became violent. He went behind the bar with a bar stool and began to toss, kick, and punch Obrycka after she attempted to push him back to the customer area. Eventually he stopped, and left the bar. The police were called to the bar and the manager of the bar, Kolodziej, and a patron, Cepiaszuk, informed officers that Officer Abbate was a Chicago Police officer and that the assault had been recorded on video. The officers told Obrycka to file a report at the station; they did not instruct the bar\u2019s manager to preserve the recording or to show it to them and they did not attempt to further investigate or locate Officer Abbate. An employee of the bar who was a friend of Officer Abbate\u2019s informed him that his assault on Obrycka had been recorded. The bar employee and Officer Abbate told Obrycka that Officer Abbate would pay for her medical bills and lost wages she suffered as a result of his attack as long as she did not file a complaint. Obrycka refused. Officer Abbate then threatened to arrest Obrycka, Kolodziej and Cepiaszuk for possession of cocaine and other trumped-up charges if they did not turn over the recording or destroy it. Obrycka and Kolodziej shared the tape with investigators from the Office of Professional Standards (OPS) and the police department, but they did not conduct an effective investigation. Instead, OPS proceeded to conceal the details of the case from the public. Obrycka, Kolodziej and Cepiaszuk decided to send the tape to the media. One month after the tape became public, Officer Abbate was indicted on 14 counts of aggravated battery, official misconduct and conspiracy. Abbate was found guilty of aggravated battery, but acquitted of official misconduct, and sentenced to two years probation.","magistrate_judge":"Nolan","community_area":"Belmont Cragin","latitude":41.9383973,"address":"5425 W.

As the guards were headed back to Dixon with McCormick, they were stopped by Detectives Loftus and Shebish. The detectives asked the guards to take McCormick to a police station so they could use him in a lineup. The guards initially said no because a court order only allowed them to take McCormick to and from the courthouse. The detectives then spoke to the guards in private and convinced them to take McCormick to the police lineup. During the drive to the station, the guards lied to McCormick, saying they'd talked to the warden in Dixon and gotten permission to let the detectives use him for their lineup. Once at the station, McCormick pleaded with the guards to not to leave him with the detectives because he feared they'd hurt him. The guards ignored him and detectives handcuffed McCormick to a wall. During McCormick's time in the station officers hit him in the back, stripped him naked, put him in a cold cell, and denied his request for access to a lawyer. Detectives refused to give McCormick back his clothes until he allowed them to fingerprint and photograph him without justification.","magistrate_judge":"Mason","community_area":"South Lawndale","latitude":41.8431648,"address":"2650 S.

Additional officers arrived at the scene, including a supervising officer. All of the officers debated whether they had enough evidence to arrest Swanigan, and agreed they did. The officers ordered his car to be impounded and towed. He was taken into custody and detained for more than 50 hours. During that time, he was confined to a small room, shackled to the wall, searched, fingerprinted and never told the reason for his arrest. The defendants subjected him to psychological and physical abuse to coerce a false confession. They interrogated him and moved him repeatedly from one police station to another at all hours of the day and night. During these two days, Swanigan was denied access to an attorney his father, a retired police officer, was denied access to his son. Upon release, Swanigan was given two citations, for driving on a suspended license and driving without insurance. These false traffic charges were later dropped. He received paperwork indicating that his car had been towed for possession of an unlawful firearm, even though the officers did not find a firearm in the car.","magistrate_judge":"Schenkier","community_area":"Irving Park","latitude":41.9597579,"address":"4343 N.

A few weeks later, Wisniewski was asleep in his apartment when officers with the police department's Special Operations Section (SOS) broke in and woke him up with a gun in his face. Officers had no justification for this and were only there to ask Anthony Wisniewski where his father, Donald Wisniewski, lived. Anthony Wisniewski gave officers the address and soon after moved back home with his parents. On Feb. 15, 2003 only Allan Wisniewski, 14, was home when officers forced themselves through the front door without justification. Officers pushed Allan Wisniewski against a wall before taking him to the dining room to ask where his father kept his guns and where his father and brother were. Terrified, Allan Wisniewski answered all their questions. Officers stole seven of Donald Wisniewski's guns, but only inventoried four of them, and then arrested Donald Wisniewski and Anthony Wisniewski at a nearby local tavern. Both men were taken to the 8th District where Donald Wisniewski was charged with failure to register his guns and Anthony Wisniewski was charged with disorderly conduct. Donald Wisniewski was also threatened with a child endangerment charge, prison or death should he file a complaint about his arrest or any officers. While at the station Donald Wisniewski saw officers carrying some of his guns and asked why they were wearing them. Officer Herrera said, \"Shut the f--- up...we are the f---ing police and can do what we want.\" Five weeks later, officers punched and beat Anthony Wisniewski on Archer Avenue after he was unable to provide them with the name of someone who had guns, drugs, or money they could steal from. As a result of this attack, Anthony Wisniewski received eight stitches at a hospital. Fearing for their lives, the plaintiffs moved downstate. The officers later faced felony charges when the State's Attorney's Office investigated the SOS's criminal activities.","magistrate_judge":"Cox","community_area":"Garfield Ridge","latitude":41.796494,"address":"5322 S.

When the officers arrived, Johnson was naked and non-combative. He asked them if he could use the bathroom; they agreed, and handcuffed him. While Johnson was sitting on the toilet, naked and handcuffed, Sergeant Bednarek, without provocation, fired a Taser at him twice. Sgt. Bednarek then sprayed Johnson with two canisters of pepper spray and fired his Taser several more times, and applied electrical shocks directly to Johnson's body . Officer Lenski then sprayed Johnson with additional pepper spray. A number of officers forcibly removed Johnson from the bathroom and threw him on the dining-room floor, where Officer Coffey, who weighed more than 400 pounds, placed his knee on Johnson's shoulder and pushed his body weight into Johnson's forehead and face. Once he was on the floor, officers hog-tied Johnson and carried him by his ankles and wrists out of the house, then threw him in the back of a police wagon. When paramedics were called, Sgt. Bednarek told them to treat the officers who were overcome by the pepper spray, and not to provide care to Johnson. At some point, Johnson became unresponsive, and he later died.","magistrate_judge":"","community_area":"Auburn Gresham","latitude":41.746564,"address":"8112 S.

Following this finding by the court, Officer Haleas was investigated for filing false police reports that resulted in wrongful criminal charges. He was stripped of his assignment as a patrol officer and was indicted on 10 felony counts, including official misconduct, obstructing justice and perjury.

He voluntarily accompanied the two officers to Area 2 Headquarters. He was placed into an interrogation room, forced onto a bench and handcuffed to a metal ring attached to the wall. Andrews was questioned about gunshots at a dog fight and asked if he knew two men\u2014murder victims whose deaths the officers were investigating. Shortly after, the officers accused Andrews of murdering the men. According to police reports, Burge, a police lieutenant and commanding officer of the Area 2 Detective Violent Crimes Unit, had coordinated and supervised the investigation of the murders, including Andrews\u2019 arrest and investigation. Every time he was questioned, Andrews denied any involvement. As a result, the officers began to physically and verbally abuse Andrews. During the abuse, Andrews was denied access to an attorney, a phone call, food and his Miranda rights. Andrews endured a beating with a heavy-duty police-issue flashlight and continuous fist punches. The officers attempted to coach Andrews with the details of the murder, instructing him what he was to say in a statement to the State\u2019s Attorney \u2019s Office. During this coaching session, Andrews was repeatedly struck with the flashlight. After eight hours of interrogation and torture, Andrews confessed to murdering one of the two victims by reciting the story that was given to him. After this first statement, the officers continued to physically and psychologically torture him. Four hours after his first statement, and twelve hours after being arrested, Andrews confessed to the second murder. During the murder trials, Andrews presented his sworn testimony about the abuses to which he was subjected prior to his coerced statements. The officers testified that Andrews had confessed voluntarily, without coercing or striking him. Andrews was convicted of the murders without any physical evidence linking him to the crime. Andrews was incarcerated for 24 years for crimes he did not commit.","magistrate_judge":"","community_area":"Pullman","latitude":41.6921756,"address":"727 E. 111th St.","location":"Area 2 Police Station"},{"date_closed":"4/6/2012","primary_cause":"MALICIOUS PROSECUTION","victims":[{"victim_1_race":"African-American","victim_1":"Frank Davis"}],"total_payments":20000,"plaintiff_attorney_firm":"Office of the Illinois Attorney General","tags":"","date_filed":"10/16/2008","address":"","officers":[],"city_attorney_firm":"Corp Counsel","narrative":"NULL","location":"Macon County IL","case_number":"08-CV-5944","judge":"Feinerman","date_of_incident":"10/25/2005","city_attorney":"Tiffany Yvette Harris","payments":[{"date_paid":"4/12/2012","payee":"DAVIS, FRANK","primary_cause":"MALICIOUS PROSECUTION","disposition":"SETTLEMENT","case_number":"08-CV-5944","fees":"0","payment":20000}],"plaintiff_attorney":"Jessica Megan Scheller","slug":"08-cv-5944","causes":"False arrest Malicious prosecution","magistrate_judge":""},{"date_closed":"7/29/2011","police_beat_id":"1431","neighborhood":"Logan Square","tags":"Assault of a PO charges Hospital Taser","city_attorney":"Anthony L.

The interaction eventually became hostile and violent when one member of the group punched Moore\u2019s friend in the face. Moore had gotten out of his car in an attempt to stop the altercation. Outnumbered and fearful, the two friends split up and ran. Moore was followed by the group and beaten. He was knocked unconscious several times, and after the third time, felt someone twist his arm behind his back. He turned over and hit the individual in an attempt to escape, not knowing that the individual was Officer Goodwin. In response, Officer Goodwin began to kick and punch Moore along with the rest of the crowd. Moore informed the officer that he was not resisting arrest, therefore the officer could stop. The officer did not stop kicking and punching Moore, and did not make an attempt to stop the crowd from hitting him, either. A call was placed for crowd control and several more officers arrived at the scene. Moore was charged with armed robbery, aggravated battery and resisting arrest. Disciplinary action was not taken against the crowd, or Officer Goodwin, for assaulting him.","magistrate_judge":"Brown","community_area":"Chatham","latitude":41.75126340000001,"address":"7900 S.

While he was being treated for his injuries at the hospital, officers took Wells into custody. Blood and urine tests confirmed there were no drugs, alcohol or other substance in Wells\u2019 body that would have impaired his ability to drive at the time of the accident. Despite these results, officers detained Wells for more than 48 hours at the 2nd District station, where he displayed signs of being unwell: he had difficulty standing and walking, moaned in pain, was disoriented, talked incoherently, was unable to answer questions, defecated and urinated on himself, and was not provided with food or drink. Officers failed to provide immediate medical attention even when his out-of-state relatives and an attorney called and pleaded for him to be returned to the hospital. Officers also had access to Wells\u2019 discharge papers from the hospital, which instructed him to return if his symptoms worsened. After his release from the station, an ambulance rushed Wells to the hospital, where he died six weeks later due to the extent of his injuries and the prolonged time that it took for him to receive adequate treatment. He was never charged with any criminal conduct in relation to the accident and was only given a traffic citation for negligent driving.","magistrate_judge":"","community_area":"Armour Square","latitude":41.8529572,"address":"138 W.

The victim was white and only knew her attacker was African-American and that he'd warned her not to open her eyes or she'd be killed. She also contracted multiple sexually transmitted diseases from the rape. Based on an anonymoust tip, officers brought the victim to Ben's Meat Market, where Cage worked, and she identified him as her attacker. At the time of the rape, Cage was at home with his fiance and, once in police custody, he could prove he had no sexually transmitted diseases. Officers charged Cage with the 15-year-old's rape anyway, and his bond was set at half a million dollars, which the plaintiff's family was unable to pay. Officers also tried to link a second, unrelated rape of a 29-year-old African-American woman to the Cage, but Cage was later acquitted of this other woman's rape thanks to DNA evidence. Instead of trying to find the victim's actual attacker, officers then decided to portray Cage as a serial rapist and tie him to a string of at least eight other rapes alongside the one involving the 15-year-old girl. To this end, officers fabricated evidence, manipulated witnesses, destroyed police reports and obscured the fact that Cage's DNA and fingerprints were never found at the crime scene where the 15-year-old girl was raped. In 1996, Cage was convicted of three counts of aggravated criminal sexual assault and sentenced to 20 years in prison. While incarcerated, Cage pleaded with the courts to permit DNA testing on the biological material recovered from the 15-year-old victim's rape, even offering to pay for the testing himself. His requests were denied until 2006, when the Cook County State's Attorneys' Office finally agreed to the testing. Cage was exonerated and the criminal charges against him were dismissed thanks to the DNA evidence.","magistrate_judge":"","community_area":"Greater Grand Crossing","latitude":41.7692655,"address":"2 W. 69th St.","location":"69th and State Street"},{"date_closed":"3/30/2012","police_beat_id":"0313","neighborhood":"Woodlawn","tags":"Assault of a PO charges False Report Firearm Minor","city_attorney":"Kathleen D.

The officers told them to stand near the trunk of the vehicle while the officers searched the car. No contraband was found. Two additional officers arrived at the scene to assist the first two officers. Lee was freed from the handcuffs as one officer stated that he had found an expired search warrant from Memphis for Lee. After having the handcuffs removed and hearing that there was no valid warrant for his arrest, Lee thought he was free to leave, and began to walk back to the open passenger side door of his nephew\u2019s car. As he did so, one of the officers jumped on top of him and knocked him across the front seats of the car. The officer knelt down on the front passenger seat and choked Lee by wrapping both of his hands around his throat. While Lee was being choked, another officer placed his gun into Lee\u2019s mouth and said that he would shoot him. The officer removed the gun from his mouth, inserted a can of pepper spray and sprayed him in his mouth and face. Lee was ordered to roll out of the car onto the street on his belly, where his wrists were handcuffed behind his back. While handcuffed and lying on the street, another officer shot Lee with a Taser gun multiple times. Another officer attempted to snap Lee\u2019s fingers one by one and succeeded in breaking one finger. After assaulting him, the officers dragged him into a police wagon. He was taken to the police station and questioned about a bag containing a white, powdery substance that was not found on him or in his nephew\u2019s car. Lee was charged with possession of 15 or more grams of cocaine. He was in federal custody at the time he filed the lawsuit.","magistrate_judge":"Rowland","community_area":"South Shore","latitude":41.7588921,"address":"2040 E. 75th St.","location":""},{"date_closed":"3/28/2013","police_beat_id":"2523","neighborhood":"Avondale","tags":"Home invasion Plain-clothes","city_attorney":"Daniel Francis Gallagher","police_district_id":"25","longitude":-87.72494999999999,"case_number":"09-CV-3265","judge":"Shadur","date_of_incident":"9/24/2008","city_attorney_firm":"Cook County State's Attorney","plaintiff_attorney":"Jerome F.

While Favila was bleeding on the ground, other officers struck him in the ribs and stomach. At the same time, officers proceeded to enter the first floor apartment where Estevane lived. Estevane quickly took her cellphone and called 911. One of the officers grabbed her phone and threw it. She was ordered to get on her knees and her hands were handcuffed behind her back.

The first arrest took place in July 2008, when officers Perez and Mook issued Wright a ticket for excessive noise as he sat in his parked car on West Lunt Avenue. Perez then threw Wright against the car and handcuffed him. The two officers took Wright to the 24th District police station, but refused to let him call his lawyer, give him his medication for high blood pressure and back pain, let him see a doctor or give him any food, water or access to the bathroom. The next day, officers took Wright to Cook County Jail, but authorities there refused to jail him because the arrest stemmed from a ticket, not a crime. Back at the 24th District station, a supervisor ordered officers to release Wright. Several months later, the ticket was dismissed and the City of Chicago was ordered to pay Wright back for the costs he incurred from towing and storage of his car after the arrest. Wright later filed a civil rights suit against Perez and Mook. About a year later, in June 2009, Wright was again ticketed for playing his music too loud--this time by two officers, Vanourek and Pietrusiewicz, who worked the same shift as Perez and Mook. Vanourek and Pietrusiewicz again arrested Wright, took him to the police station and impounded and searched his car. This time, Wright was released the same day; the following month, the city dismissed the ticket. Later on the same day the ticket was dismissed, Wright was driving west on Rogers Avenue near Clark Street, when Vanourek and Officer Cerkic made a U-turn, stopped him in a private parking lot on Clark, cited him again for excessive noise--even though the radio in his car wasn\u2019t working--and arrested him. Vanourek shoved Wright into the squad car, hitting Wright\u2019s head on the car. Wright was charged with resisting arrest and spent three days in jail, but was later found not guilty of the charges. In August 2009, Wright was stopped by police once again, this time for allegedly driving his car over the divider line on North Clark. Sgt. Baranowski searched Wright and arrested him for allegedly having a small baggy of marijuana in his front pocket. The case was later dismissed.","magistrate_judge":"Brown","community_area":"Rogers Park","latitude":42.00895680000001,"address":"1745 W.

Two other men, in fact, committed the crimes.

Throughout the 26 years Logan spent in prison, he pleaded with the judicial system to hear evidence concerning his innocence . When the man who killed the correctional officer died in 2008, his former attorneys disclosed a 1982 affidavit pertaining to Logan\u2019s innocence and their client\u2019s guilt in the case. This led a judge to overturn Logan\u2019s conviction, and the State to grant him a Certificate of Innocence.

After questioning the officers at the station, an officer told Brewer he needed to leave, and threatened him with arrest. Brewer left and began to drive away when officers followed him and pulled over his vehicle. The officers ran a name check on him, which revealed no warrants, and they let him go. Several days later, Brewer was back in Michigan when a relative told him his photo was on the TV news as well as the internet , and that police claimed that Brewer was part of the drug-selling ring they were investigating. Eight months later, Brewer was visiting relatives in Oak Lawn when Oak Lawn police officers arrested him on a warrant for his alleged involvement in the drug conspiracy the Chicago police officers were investigating. At his bond hearing, Brewer was charged with four deliveries of narcotics to undercover officers and with being part of a drug conspiracy. Brewer could not afford to post his bail, and he remained in custody at the Cook County Jail for nine months . After reviewing the evidence and hearing testimony from the defendant officers, the trial judge dismissed the charges against Brewer, finding that the officers had incorrectly identified him.","magistrate_judge":"Cox","community_area":"Chicago Lawn","latitude":41.779162,"address":"3420 W. 63rd St.","location":"8th District Police Station"},{"date_closed":"12/9/2010","police_beat_id":"0113","neighborhood":"Loop","tags":"Protest","city_attorney":"Geri Lynn Yanow","police_district_id":"1","longitude":-87.62934109999999,"case_number":"09-CV-754","judge":"Marovich","date_of_incident":"1/7/2008","city_attorney_firm":"Corp Counsel","plaintiff_attorney":"Melinda L.

Before leaving the jail, photographs of his face and upper body torso were taken. Upon his arrival at Area 2, Castleberry told Detective Ghaston of his mental illness and his need to receive his psychotropic drugs while being held in custody for the lineup. Detective Ghaston refused to provide him with his medications. The day after his initial transfer, Castleberry was finally placed in an Area 2 lockup for processing and assigned to a one-person cell under close observation. He was taken to the hospital for a psychiatric evaluation but was not given his prescribed medications. He was then returned to Area 2. Castleberry saw Officer Jones putting on a jacket that would conceal his badge number. Officer Jones then assaulted Castleberry, continuously striking him in the head and face with his fist, punching him in the face and body, and hitting and kicking him until his forehead was cut and bleeding. Officer Godinez joined in the attack, kicking Castleberry while he was on the floor. Castleberry tried to run away, but was grabbed by the neck, slammed down on the floor and dragged down the corridor of the lockup, bleeding . He was eventually taken to the hospital for treatment. To cover up their misconduct, Officers Jones and Godinez charged Castleberry with aggravated battery and aggravated criminal sexual assault. The sexual assault charges were for the lineup at Area 2 that he had been a part of. Upon his return to Cook County Jail, photographs of Castleberry\u2019s face, neck and upper torso were taken again, as evidence that his assault did not take place within the jail. Castleberry received further medical care at the Cook County Jail.","magistrate_judge":"Brown","community_area":"Fuller Park","latitude":41.8017506,"address":"5101 S.

A week later, officers requested and were granted a warrant to search the plaintiffs' home for someone named Lennell Jones and to seize any dogs at the residence owned by a felon because of suspected animal abuse. The plaintiffs had never heard of Jones and he was never at their home when officers had earlier repeatedly visited it. Regardless, officers went to the home, arrested the plaintiffs, took away their dogs and other possessions, and filed criminal charges against them.

When the computer query revealed that the subject of the interrogation was not sought in an outstanding warrant but did have previous drug arrests, the widespread practice among Chicago police officers was to arrest the suspect and falsely assert that the he or she had possessed a small quantity of a controlled substance.","location":"","case_number":"10-CV-7094","judge":"Durkin","date_of_incident":"11/3/2008","city_attorney":"Jonathan Clark Green","payments":[{"date_paid":"3/13/2013","payee":"FLAXMAN, KENNETH N.","primary_cause":"FALSE ARREST/MALICIOUS PROSECUTION","disposition":"SETTLEMENT","case_number":"10-CV-7094","fees":"0","payment":3000}],"plaintiff_attorney":"Kenneth N.

Afraid, Triplett ran away. But as he crossed a neighbor\u2019s yard to try and reach his godmother\u2019s front door, an officer jumped out of a police car on Michigan and ordered Triplett to get on the ground. Triplett told the officer, \u201cYou\u2019ve got the wrong guy, the guy with a gun is in the alley.\u201d  But the officer arrested Triplett anyway, and as he was waiting in the back of the squad car other officers came up, including an off-duty officer Triplett recognized as a resident of the neighborhood. The off-duty officer told Triplett, \u201cYou\u2019re breaking into houses now, I should break your face.\u201d Triplett then heard the group of officers talking with the man who had pulled a gun on him, and realized the incident was about an attempted break-in of a home on 89th Street. The officers took Triplett to the 6th District police station and tried to convince him to admit to the crime. Triplett refused. He was held overnight and charged with criminal trespass. At Triplett\u2019s first court date, he was offered one year\u2019s probation in exchange for a guilty plea, but refused and said he hadn\u2019t committed any crime and was given a June 2010 trial date. Meanwhile, police conspired to implicate Triplett for the burglary of Officer Howard\u2019s home; Howard\u2019s home was a few miles from the home on 89th Street where the May 2010 attempted break-in took place. The morning of Triplett\u2019s trial for the May 2010 burglary, three officers came to his home in the 10600 block of South Prairie Avenue to arrest him for the Howard burglary, falsely claiming to have a warrant, using \u201cfoul and abusive language\u201d and entering the home even though they were told Triplett wasn\u2019t there. Later that morning, the May 2010 case against Triplett was dismissed--but he was re-arrested for the Howard burglary as he left the courthouse. Police claimed that the physical evidence--fingerprints and DNA--pointed to Triplett, even though the fingerprints didn\u2019t match and Triplett had never provided a DNA sample to police. Triplett couldn\u2019t make bond in the case, however, and ended up spending two months in Cook County Jail before the charges were dropped.","magistrate_judge":"Corp Counsel","community_area":"Chatham","latitude":41.7327469,"address":"8900 S.

The officers choked, kneed and grabbed Hunt by the head in a chokehold. Hunt continued to complain that what the officers were doing was wrong, and that his rights were being violated. One of the officers pulled out a Taser gun and prepared to use it on Hunt\u2019s mother, who asked what was going on. Another officer sprayed mace on another attendee. Hunt was then arrested, taken to the police station and charged with obstructing a peace officer and aggravated battery of a peace officer. At the station, Hunt told the officers that people at the gathering had recorded the assault with their cellphones. The officers told Hunt that if he turned over any of the videos, they would do something for him on the charges. Hunt declined. He was booked, charged and incarcerated for months until he could raise bail. Hunt was given a plea offer, but he refused to plead guilty. The officers continued the persecution for more than a year until Hunt was found not guilty.","magistrate_judge":"Keys","community_area":"North Lawndale","latitude":41.8621479,"address":"3653 W.

Brinkley did not know the individuals and only observed as they were being searched. The officers did not approach, speak or attempt to search Brinkley when they reached the bus stop. One of the officers looked over at Brinkley and told him to turn around and place his hands on the wall. As the officers approached to search him, Brinkley ran away; he admitted to have been carrying a small amount of marijuana at that time for personal use. Eventually, he surrendered to Officer Matlock a short distance away from the bus stop. Officer Matlock ordered Brinkley to get down on his knees while keeping his hands up in the air. Brinkley complied. While he was still on his knees with his hands up in the air, the officers shot Brinkley in his back with a Taser stun gun. Officer Santiago proceeded to spray mace on Brinkley as he lay on the ground after being shot with the Taser gun. After suffering from two Taser shots and mace on his face, Brinkley was placed in a police wagon and taken to the police station. At the station, he was charged with unlawful use of a weapon as well as charges related to the marijuana in his possession. Brinkley did not have a weapon on him during the time of arrest. The arresting officers testified that they had to pry Brinkley\u2019s hands away from the alleged gun found on him, but they were not able to provide any evidence. He was detained in Cook County Jail for more than eight months pending the gun possession charge and found not guilty on all charges.

Among the officers present at the crime scene was Lieutenant Burge, who worked with other Area 2 police officers to charge Caine with a crime he did not commit. The officers forced Caine and his co-defendant into making false confessions by using psychological and physical torture. While alone in his interrogation room, Caine\u2019s co-defendant scratched into the bench that he had been tortured and that his statements to the police were false. Finally giving in after hours of torture , the co-defendant signed a false statement regarding his involvement in the murders. He also claimed, through instruction from Lt. Burge and the other officers, that Caine had been present at the murder scene. Caine was arrested at his mother\u2019s home that same night based solely on the co-defendant\u2019s coerced statement. No other evidence implicated Caine\u2019s involvement in the crime. In his interrogation room, Caine insisted he knew nothing of the killings. Officer Madigan proceeded to coach and Caine with details of the murder for his statement. When Caine refused to sign the prepared statement, Officer Madigan struck him with a cupped hand on the side of his head, rupturing his eardrum. In pain from the ruptured eardrum and fearing additional torture, Caine signed the statement. At trial, Caine continued to maintain his innocence and even testified about the torture that he endured. Despite this, he was convicted of murder, home invasion and residential burglary. He spent 25 years in prison until he was ultimately exonerated.","magistrate_judge":"Brown","community_area":"Pullman","latitude":41.6921756,"address":"727 E. 111th St.","location":""},{"date_closed":"4/17/2014","police_beat_id":"0623","neighborhood":"Grand Crossing","tags":"Car impounded Firearm Hospital Recorded Resisting arrest charges Shooting Stolen property Traffic stop","city_attorney":"George John Yamin Jr.","police_district_id":"6","longitude":-87.618011,"case_number":"11-CV-9275","judge":"Chang","date_of_incident":"1/1/2010","city_attorney_firm":"Corp Counsel","plaintiff_attorney":"Brendan Shiller","slug":"11-cv-9275","causes":"Conspiracy Excessive force Unlawful search/seizure","neighborhood_id":"Grand Crossing","primary_cause":"FALSE ARREST/EXCESSIVE FORCE","total_payments":25000,"plaintiff_attorney_firm":"Shiller Preyar Law Offices","police_district":"6th","date_filed":"12/29/2011","community_area_id":"69","officers":[],"police_beat":"#0623","payments":[{"date_paid":"8/14/2013","payee":"NICHOLS, JEFFREY","primary_cause":"FALSE ARREST/EXCESSIVE FORCE","disposition":"SETTLEMENT","case_number":"11-CV-9275","fees":"0","payment":25000}],"victims":[{"victim_1_race":"African-American","victim_1":"Courtney Thomas"}],"narrative":"Nichols and Thomas, both African-American, were driving in Nichols\u2019 car on East 75th Street near South Prairie Avenue when they noticed a police car behind them.

The following month, a convicted felon serving time in a downstate prison called detectives from Area 3 and promised information about the murders in exchange for a transfer to a work-release program. He told the detectives that Reeves and another man had separately called him and confessed to the murders, which was not true. The detectives and an assistant state's attorney had the informant call the two men at least 36 times to try to get them to admit to the crime, but neither of them did so. Nevertheless, officers arrested one of the men and brought him to Area 3, where they tortured him by beating him with a blackjack, telephone and telephone book, and kicking and punching him repeatedly over several hours. Eventually, the man gave a false confession, implicating himself and Reeves in the murders. Reeves was arrested in August 1988, and the two men were wrongfully charged with the murders. They were both convicted. In 1995, their convictions were vacated, but they were re-tried and re-convicted in 1997, again based almost entirely on the informant\u2019s false testimony. In 2009, after evidence of the practice of torture by the \"midnight crew\" led by Commander Burge and the other defendant officers had been uncovered, Reeves was exonerated and released from prison after 21 years .","location":"","case_number":"11-L-5069","judge":"James N.

The warrant was for the same first floor apartment where Robison and Walker currently lived. Walker had recently rented the first floor apartment from Burns, the building owner, who lived on the second floor. The first floor unit had been vacant for approximately one year, and Burns had remodeled it during that time. Walker and Robinson were over the age of 50, their son Ray Robinson Jr. was 24, and Graham was 39. That afternoon, Robinson, his son and Graham were watching television when seven or eight officers in plainclothes and one in uniform crashed through two hall doors with a slam bar. With their guns drawn, the officers yelled at everyone to get on the ground. They struck Ray Robinson, his son and Graham several times. The officers never asked for any identification and handcuffed all three men, repeatedly yelling, \u201cWhere are the drugs?\u201d The junior Robinson was slapped and strip-searched, while another officer stomped on Graham\u2019s head and right wrist while he was handcuffed and on the floor. Officers repeatedly demanded to see \u201cthe gun\u201d they believed to be in the apartment. The apartment was left in disarray: the television thrown off its stand, the washer and air conditioner broken, photographs torn up, and various items gone. Finding no guns or drugs, the officers broke into the second floor apartment and damaged it in a similar manner while Burns was not home. When he finally arrived, the police were gone. The officers did not charge anyone in either residence.","magistrate_judge":"Nolan","community_area":"Englewood","latitude":41.783049,"address":"1021 W. 61st St.","location":""},{"date_closed":"6/14/2012","police_beat_id":"0814","neighborhood":"Garfield Ridge","tags":"Drugs False Report Firearm","city_attorney":"Christopher A.

Coffie was slammed headfirst into the back seat of the squad car. His head ended up on the floor, between the two seats. He was bleeding from his face and having difficulty breathing, so he sat up.

Seven hours later, two detectives informed him they were charging him with two counts of assault to a police officer.

The officers broke through the back door and entered her apartment with their guns drawn. During this time, Chester was on the phone with the father of her children, instructing him to pick them up. One of the officers, Officer Coleman, proceeded to strike Green in the face and handcuff him to a chair. That same officer called Chester a \u201cbitch\u201d and a \u201cf---ing monkey,\u201d took the phone from her, grabbed her by the hair and threw her face first into the ground. He continued to beat her, kicking and punching her face and body and stomping on her stomach. After the beating ended, Officer Williams told Chester this would not have happened if she had come out the front door. Green and Chester were then taken into custody and Chester was charged with domestic battery and destruction of property. Green was not charged. Chester appeared in court and her son dropped the domestic battery charge. The remaining charge was later dismissed.","magistrate_judge":"Brown","community_area":"Auburn Gresham","latitude":41.7556559,"address":"1421 W. 76th St.","location":""},{"date_closed":"5/2/2014","primary_cause":"EXCESSIVE FORCE/SERIOUS","victims":[{"victim_1_race":"Unknown","victim_1":"Jerome Anderson"}],"total_payments":495000,"plaintiff_attorney_firm":"Law Offices of Daniel S.

One of the passengers was caught. Cherry was a known associate of one of the passengers, and police detained and interrogated Cherry to ask questions about the hit-and-run homicide, of which he knew nothing. Two months later, Cherry was falsely arrested as an accomplice to an unrelated armed robbery. When taken in for questioning to the CPD Precinct at 5101 S. Wentworth Ave., officers and two prosecutors interrogated Cherry about the hit-and-run case, not the armed robbery for which he had just been arrested. Still unable to provide them with information, he was taken into a lineup, and later told that he was identified by the victims of the robbery. The officers then asked Cherry if there was anything he would like to tell them now that he had been \u201cidentified.\u201d Still unable to tell the officers anything, Cherry was charged with armed robbery, burglary, unlawful restraint and unlawful use of a weapon by a felon and was held in the Cook County Department of Corrections until he posted bail a year later. As Cherry awaited trial, the state continued to use the armed robbery charge as a bargaining chip to pressure him into testifying about the homicide. Cherry was found not guilty in December 2010.","magistrate_judge":"Cox","community_area":"Fuller Park","latitude":41.8017506,"address":"5101 S.

After her daughter left, Murphy went to sleep in a bedroom in the hospitality suite while other guests remained. One of the guests woke up later Murphy to tell her that there were security guards and Chicago police officers at the door. As Murphy told the officers that the guests at the suite were permitted to be there, one of the guests continued to drink from a champagne bottle. This angered the officers, who demanded that the guest put the bottle down. Murphy continued to explain that all the guests had the right to be there, further angering the officers, who restrained and arrested her. They also signed a criminal complaint against Murphy on behalf of the hotel for disorderly conduct. She was taken to the 1st District station and processed. While in custody, Murphy was kept handcuffed in a cell. Prior to the trial, the chief security officer for the hotel went to court and asked to drop the charge against Murphy.

Barksdale-Sullers, who suffers from a fainting condition, became upset and collapsed; one officer kicked and pulled her by her coat while she was on the ground. The officers ordered McWilliams to get inside a marked police sport-utility vehicle.

The officers then accused him of resisting arrest and shot him twice with a Taser gun, causing him to fall to the ground. McWilliams has a heart condition, and was afraid the shocks would affect the functioning of his heart. He was taken to the hospital for treatment and released back to the police. He was charged with driving under the influence, resisting arrest and various traffic offenses. His car was also impounded and not returned.

In particular, Officer Taylor became focused on a cable box that she had loaned to Samuels and Acuna a year before. Officer Taylor would bang on their front and back doors and demand that they return the cable box. One morning when Acuna left home for work and Samuels was alone with the baby, Officer Taylor and her teenage son began banging loudly at the front door. Samuels was afraid to open the door. Officer Taylor proceeded to cut off the power to Samuels\u2019 apartment, hoping that the July heat would force her out. Ten minutes after the power was shut off, Samuels was able to reach the building\u2019s maintenance person to turn the power back on. However, 20 minutes later, Officer Taylor turned the power off again. This time Samuels was not able to reach the maintenance person and was forced to run down to the basement, leaving her infant son alone in a high chair. When Samuels entered the basement, Officer Taylor, her teenage son, and Officer Kirk confronted her. Officer Taylor demanded Samuels\u2019 keys and struck Samuels in the face several times. Officer Kirk punched her several times. Samuels tried to run away, but Officer Kirk shoved her into a door and punched her on the face, causing a split lip and a large gash on her head. She was put in a chokehold, handcuffed and dragged down the stairs into the foyer. When additional officers arrived at the scene, Officer Kirk stated that he was an off duty officer trying to arrest a woman who had battered two officers. The arriving officers told Samuels that she was being arrested, and allowed her to wait with her son while her sister and husband arrived. She was taken to the police station, and after pleading for medical treatment, was taken to the hospital. She was charged with two misdemeanor complaints of battery. When Acuna went to the police station to see his wife, Officer Kirk confronted and arrested him for misdemeanor assault on an officer.","magistrate_judge":"Keys","community_area":"South Shore","latitude":41.765037,"address":"7133 S.

He had 20 friends on board and was playing music when officers pulled alongside him in a police boat. As they boarded The Flying Lady, officers told him they were investigating a noise violation and demanded to see Izsak's identification and the yacht's paperwork. Once Officer Funchion was on The Flying Lady he told Izsak he needed to inspect the safety of the yacht. The hull of the yacht facing the police boat had a sticker showing that the Coast Guard had already inspected The Flying Lady at the beginning of the boating season. Izsak also gave officers paperwork showing his yacht had passed the Coast Guard's highest level of safety standards. Officer Funchion ignored this and continued his safety inspection while repeatedly asking Izsak how he could afford the yacht in front of his guests. During the inspection, Officer Funchion asked Izsak if he had anything illegal on The Flying Lady and was getting visibly angrier as he ransacked the yacht's bedroom, drawers and cabinets without justification. When nothing illegal was found, Officer Funchion falsely claimed Vosatka spit on him in order to threaten to impound the boat and arrest the plaintiffs. He then grabbed Vosatka, 68, and handcuffed him. Officers moved Vosatka over to the police boat, ignoring his age, arm injury and other medical conditions. Officers then took Vosatka's property, broke his glasses, put a face-mask on him and refused to let him wear shoes. Vosatka refused to sign a ticket for an ordinance violation, so he was taken to the 1st District and charged with reckless conduct. After four court appearances the charge was dismissed.","magistrate_judge":"Schenkier","community_area":"Near North Side","latitude":41.890009,"address":"400 N.

Instead the harassment by officers intensified, with Officers Campbell and Barajas arresting Morado's son without justification on May 10, 2011. Officers released the teenager without charges but falsely entered his name into a police database that tracks gang membership. Officer Handzel then contacted community members, news media and the mayor's office to spread false information about the teenager as a \"known gang-banger.\"","location":"Garfield Ridge","case_number":"12-CV-752","judge":"Durkin","date_of_incident":"4/28/2010","city_attorney":"Erica A.

During the divorce process, defendent Kimble-Figueroa was also having an affair with Officer Campbell. Because of this, Officer Campbell abused his police powers in an effort to get Figueroa to give up visitation and custody rights of his children. In one instance, Officer Campbell eavesdropped on a phone conversation Figueroa was having with Kimble-Figueroa about their children. During the call, Officer Campbell grabbed the phone from Kimble-Figueroa and threatened Figueroa with arrest if he didn't fully cooperate with her during the divorce. The following day, Figueroa went to his wife's home to drop off his children. Officer Campbell was standing with other unknown officers in full uniform, blocking Figueroa's path to the building's entrance. Officer Campbell told Figueroa he'd been called to supervise the transfer of the children. This was a lie, because there was no complaint or court order asking Officer Campbell to be there. The following week, Figueroa picked up his children from his wife's home and took them to a museum. When he brought his children home, Officer Campbell and unknown officers arrested Figueroa without justification and charged him with phone harassment, based on the earlier phone call. Officer Campbell made the arrest and falsified police reports in order to help Kimble-Figueroa in her divorce proceedings. After a criminal trial, Figueroa was found not guilty.","location":"","case_number":"12-CV-8453","judge":"Darrah","date_of_incident":"12/27/2011","city_attorney":"Kathryn M.

Ahmed began to record the incident on her cell phone and continued recording once police arrived. When police saw Ahmed taping, they approached her from behind, threw her onto the hood of a police car, took her phone, handcuffed her and slammed her head several times against the hood of the car. Police then took her to a police station and falsely charged her with battery to a police officer, resisting arrest and disorderly conduct. After she was released, Ahmed got her phone back but the video of the incident was erased.

After the second traffic stop, Cooke filed a complaint with the Independent Police Review Authority. Officer Rodriguez was later charged with bribery and official misconduct. After Cooke appeared in court 11 times, the charges against him were dropped.","magistrate_judge":"Mason","community_area":"North Lawndale","latitude":41.86672009999999,"address":"3200 W.

Ruben Garcia stayed with his children in the family's truck while his wife, Celina Garcia, went inside the restaurant. Suddenly and without justification, Officer Castillo approached the driver's side of the truck with his gun pointed at Ruben Garcia. He yelled at Garcia to \"Get the f--- out of the truck\" or he'd shoot him and put his children in the Department of Children and Family Services. Garcia got out and Officer Castillo handcuffed him. Officer Castillo then wrote a ticket to impound the plaintiffs' truck because he didn't think Garcia followed his orders quickly enough. Celina Garcia was still inside the restaurant when Officer Erickson approached her and told her to go outside. When she walked out, she saw her children in the truck, but did not see her husband. She asked the officers about her husband, and received no response. She asked the officers if she could get her children from the truck, but officers ignored her. Because of this she began recording what was happening on her cell phone. Officer Castillo threatened to arrest her if she didn't stop recording, so she stopped. As the truck was being impounded, Celina Garcia told officers where she lived, that she had a valid driver's license and insurance and could drive the truck back home. Officers impounded the truck anyways and refused to give Celina Garcia and her children a ride in their squad car, purposely forcing them to walk back to Indiana. Ruben Garcia was arrested and driven to the 4th District where his personal items, which included a Rolex watch and wedding ring, were taken from him and put in an inventory bag. On the drive to the station officers threatened Ruben Garcia with jail but once there they only issued him two tickets before releasing him.

They threated to hold him for 72 hours unless he submitted to a lie detector test, knowing that this would cause him to miss his own wedding. They ignored McGee's repeated requests for a lawyer. Officers Bartik, Farley and Lenihan then conspired to fabricate a story that McGee confessed to the murder twice, once to Officer Bartik and once to all three officers. Based on this fabricated confession, and no other evidence, McGee was charged with the murder, even though DNA from blood found at the scene did not match him and, in fact, matched two other people. McGee was incarcerated for more than three years before he was finally acquitted by a jury.

Daley. The groups got into a verbal argument. Suddenly, without provocation, Vanecko punched Koschman in the face, knocking him to the ground. Koschman hit his head on the pavement, resulting in skull fractures and massive internal bleeding. Within hours of the incident, Daley or a close associate learned about Vanecko\u2019s involvement and reached out to high-ranking Police Department officials who immediately stopped the investigation. Koschman never regained consciousness and died in the hospital about two weeks later. His death was ruled a homicide and the investigation was reopened. Detectives changed and fabricated reports and concealed evidence from witness statements in order to minimize or hide Vanecko\u2019s involvement and portray Koschman as the aggressor. The reports were used by the Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office to avoid bringing criminal charges against Vanecko.In 2011, a new investigation was ordered by then-Supt. Jody Weis, but detectives once again fabricated information and conspired with Daley\u2019s office and the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office to ensure that Vanecko wouldn\u2019t be charged. In 2012, a Cook County judge appointed a special prosecutor in the case. After he was indicted, Vanecko pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter.","magistrate_judge":"Schenkier","community_area":"Near North Side","latitude":41.9039002,"address":"35 W.

Unbeknownst to Sperling, he'd been under surveillance by the Chicago Police Department for suspected drug activities. During the traffic stop, officers told Sperling he'd failed to use a turn signal, which was a false pretext for the stop. They handcuffed him, put him in a squad car and started searching his vehicle without asking him any questions. Earlier that day, CPD officers had asked that the Glenview Police Department officers who were assisting them turn off the audio and video systems in their squad cars so Sperling's traffic stop would not be recorded. But the CPD officers were unaware that one of the Glenview squad cars' recording capabilities had not been disabled and the entire encounter was documented. During their search officers found a bag containing illegal drugs in Sperling's vehicle and filed felony drug charges against him. At a criminal hearing, officers lied under oath, unaware of the Glenview squad car video's existence, and said Sperling was asked for his driver's license and insurance and that he told officers he had marijuana in his vehicle before they handcuffed him. The video of the traffic stop was then shown in the court, refuting what the officers had just said. The criminal court judge called the officers' conduct \"outrageous\" and said \"there's strong evidence it was a conspiracy to lie in this case, for everyone to come up with the same lie.\" The criminal charges against Sperling were dismissed.","latitude":42.0801397,"magistrate_judge":"Cox"},{"date_closed":"3/3/2015","police_beat_id":"0424","neighborhood":"South Chicago","tags":"Assault of a PO charges False Report Firearm Hospital Resisting arrest charges Shooting Stolen property","city_attorney":"Terrence Michael Burns","police_district_id":"4","longitude":-87.546525,"case_number":"14-CV-3120","judge":"St. Eve","date_of_incident":"4/30/2013","city_attorney_firm":"Dykema Gossett PLLc","plaintiff_attorney":"Ruth Z.

Moore was charged with possession of a controlled substance and aggravated battery to a police officer. In August 2013, Moore was awaiting trial when he was arrested a second time by two officers, one of whom stated that Moore was the cause of him fracturing his hand. The officers drove Moore to a nearby alley, where they slapped him in the face several times and coerced him to plead guilty in the previous arrest.

Officer Emily Campbell, who has a family member that owns a competing landscaping business, threatened to arrest the two men for passing out their fliers. That summer, Guzman was repeatedly asked by the officers to leave Wentworth Park and in many of these instances, searched without justification. Sometime in the fall, he was pulled over near South Archer Avenue and South Central Avenue by unnamed officers who searched his vehicle without cause. Though nothing illegal was uncovered, the officers issued him a false citation for driving without headlights and called him a \u201cspic.\u201d In January 2014, Officer Emily Campbell pulled Guzman over near South Narragansett Avenue and 56th Street, searched him, and released him after nothing illegal was found. Guzman was pulled over two months later by unnamed officers near his own home and accused of driving a stolen vehicle, only to be released after his mother appeared at the scene with the vehicle\u2019s title and his insurance card. Several weeks later, Guzman was again driving near his home when Officers Sautkus and Sean Campbell (Emily Campbell\u2019s husband) pulled him over. Guzman, his passenger and the vehicle were searched \u2013 a small amount of marijuana was found on his passenger and nowhere else. The officers falsely claimed that they found marijuana in Guzman\u2019s car and charged him with possession. His car was impounded and he was never able to retrieve it because he couldn\u2019t afford the fees. During the arrest, Guzman\u2019s iPhone was confiscated, never inventoried and also never returned.
